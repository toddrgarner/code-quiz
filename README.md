# Code Quiz

## How It Works

The Code Quiz works by alerting the user to start the game. Once clicked, it will start a countdown and then updates the questions and answers via vanilla Javascript. Once the answer is selected, the program checks to see if the answer is correct. 

If it is the correct answer, it will alert the user that they answered correctly. It updates their score on the screen and in localStorage. If the user answers incorrectly, time will be deducted from the clock and alert user that they answered incorrectly. 

Once the game is over, it will take them to the end screen which will display a comparison between on how they performed and if there was a previous high score. If the user becomes the new hihg score, code quiz will then ask them to input their initials into the field and submit. Once submitted, their name goes into the high score field in localStorage and on screen.
